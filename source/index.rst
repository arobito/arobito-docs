FAQ
---


So, what is Arobito?
````````````````````

Arobito is a little project created by some computer scientists who left university years ago. They try to build some
kind of a robot from scratch.

We're trying to learn about controlling hardware and software, detecting obstacles and moving around.

It's all an experiment. Nothing to lead to a productive usage. Just for fun.


Sounds good, can I join?
````````````````````````

Yes, of course. This is an open source project. The easy way: Fork the source and build your own stuff on it. We're
welcoming pull requests.

If you want to join our developer circle please don't hesitate to send us a message via github.com. For new users, we
created a :doc:`quick guide to the project <project/welcomenewuser>`.


Where can I download stuff?
```````````````````````````

This is not something you can install on your PC and simply run it. Not yet. So grab the source and go on.


Where are the building and running instructions?
````````````````````````````````````````````````

We're still working on very basic code and very basic documentation. Please be patient.


What languages are you using?
`````````````````````````````

The primary project language is Python 3.4 (see :doc:`Coding for Arobito <project/coding>` for details). But there's
also a lot of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Shell Scripts. A nice zoo.
