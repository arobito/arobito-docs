Repository Overview
===================

The Arobito Project uses a few repository to keep code, documentation and other things organized. This is an overview
over our active repositories. If you want to participate, just fork one (or all) of the repositories, and send us pull
requests. Need a kick start? Check our :doc:`Welcome new User <welcomenewuser>` quick start guide and start
contributing.

All repository name start with "arobito", you should be able to fork us whatever repository names are already under your
user account. 


arobito/arobito
---------------

The `arobito/arobito <https://github.com/arobito/arobito>`_ repository hosts the sources for the "heart" of the Arobito.
It contains all the stuff that is about to be run on the Raspberry Pi main board and is mainly written in Python. You
might want to check the documentation page ":doc:`Coding for Arobito <coding>`" for details.


arobito/arobito-mcu
-------------------

The `arobito/arobito-mcu <https://github.com/arobito/arobito-mcu>`_ repository contains the sources for the micro
controller programming for the Arobito. It also contains some experiments (in the ``experiments`` folder) with Arduinos
and some parts and backups our research and development efforts in this field. Want to know more? Check the
:doc:`Arobito MCU development page <../mcu/index>` for details.


arobito/arobito-docs
--------------------

The `arobito/arobito-docs <https://github.com/arobito/arobito-docs>`_ repository is the place for the project
documentation. The page you are currently reading is from there. We use Sphinx with reStructured Text files for
documenting virtually anything, not only the source code of the Python projects. Our documentation gets automatically
built and published by the cool guys of `ReadTheDocs.org <https://www.readthedocs.org/>`_, so that you can find the most
current version always at `arobito-docs.rtfd.org <https//arobito-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. At this time, we're
doing all documentation in English, even if English is not our native language. We're sure that this lowers the barrier
for other developers to join us.


arobito/arobito.github.io
-------------------------

The repository at `arobito/arobito.github.io <https://github.com/arobito/arobito.github.io>`_ contains the sources of
our (still empty) project website, hosted by GitHub.com under `arobito.github.io <https://arobito.github.io/>`_.
Initially, the page was created with the GitHub Page Creator, but in the future, we should build our own thing.


arobito/arobito-assets
----------------------

The `arobito/arobito-assets <https://github.com/arobito/arobito-assets>`_ repository contains all the stuff that does
not match somewhere else, for example the sources of the Arobito logo, the Arobito LaTeX document class and other
things.
